<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>Hi Everyone! My name is Lucy Menefee and I am majoring in Psychology with a Chemistry minor, previously at OSU Cascades but now Oregon State E-campus. I live in Bend, OR and absolutely love it! I really enjoy the outdoors (paddle-boarding, hiking, running and biking) and finding new trails to explore on the weekends! Fun fact about me, I have a 2-year-old Goldendoodle and am a big dog lover (he's in the picture!)   </p>
